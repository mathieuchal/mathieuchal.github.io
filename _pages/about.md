I am interested in how artificial and biological intelligence learn and develop, and how optimization and dynamical systems theory can help describe it. My PhD thesis revolves around exploring principles of synaptic plasticity for artificial neural networks, in an attempt to produce more able and adaptive systems. I work under the co-supervision of Thomas Serre @ Brown University and Rufin Van Rullen @ CNRS, and I'm part of the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute.
