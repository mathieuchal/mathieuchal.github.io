Modern 3D image recovery problems require powerful optimization frameworks to handle high dimensionality while providing reliable numerical solutions in a reasonable time. In this perspective, asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms have received an increasing attention by overcoming memory limitation issues and communication bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a block distributed Majorize-Minorize Memory Gradient (BD3MG) optimization algorithm for solving large scale non-convex differentiable optimization problems. Assuming a distributed memory environment, the algorithm casts the efficient 3MG scheme into smaller dimension subproblems where blocks of variables are addressed in an asynchronous manner. Convergence of the sequence built by the proposed BD3MG method is established under mild assumptions. Application to the restoration of 3D images degraded by a depth-variant blur shows that our method yields significant computational time reduction compared to several synchronous and asynchronous competitors, while exhibiting great scalability potential.
